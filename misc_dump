### Terminology

-   Games are considered what is being hosted
-   Each game has a mission which is defined as the gametype, etc..
-   The game mode of Captain is called Sergeant in the game files.

### Specs Required for Server Hosting

-   Still not 100%, but I was using just over 1 GB memory RAM & capping
    at 20% of 32 GB cpu, 6.4GB with 400 bots

### Other Tips / Tricks

-   Default warmup for battle is 5 minutes, possibly extends to other
    game modes.
-   you can load in new missions without restarting the server by
    entering new\_mission.
-   Server will max out at around 300 bots.

then waiting until process is cleared, then entering in the new
mission.. note that this doesn’t apparently work to clear some
parameters, in which case you need to restart (e.g., warmup time changes
won’t be overridden from the initial mission).

You won’t be able to use TDM maps for battle due to spawns

Apparently duel works with battle (to a certain extent?)

Duel can’t be preset with a map (will error out, needs to be added to a
queue).






#### Updating DedicatedServerHelper 
If there is an update to the game / DedicatedServerHelper you will need to manually update the XML of the DedicatedServerHelper module for your Dedicated Server. 

You can do this by going to the following directory: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Dedicated Server\Modules\DedicatedCustomServerHelper\SubModule.xml 

And changing the "Version value" to the version of the DedicatedServerHelper for when you launch the game. 

Note that these modules are not the correct version, the DedicatedServerHelper needs to be updated on the server side..

Update the XML to match that of the game's current version.

#### Unable to find MultiplayerForcedAvatars
The solution to this issue is:

To copy the MultiplayerForcedAvatars from your Mount & Blade II game directory, e.g.,:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Native\MultiplayerForcedAvatars

And copy and paste those files to the following path:
'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Dedicated Server\Modules\Native\MultiplayerForcedAvatars'
