Documentation for v.1.0.0. Currently, mostly, a pastebin for my own notes as the TW documentation is not comprehensive enough.

# Hosting Bannerlord Dedicated Servers

## Hosting a Server on Windows 
I'd strongly recommend following the guide created by That Horns Guy [here](https://youtu.be/9Hvuz12Bfzg), especially if this is your first time hosting a server. 

## Hosting a Server on Linux 
TW has not provided support for Dedicated Server hosting on Linux OS, however there is a community solution [here](https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/guide-dedicated-server-on-linux.454799/).

## Hosting Custom Maps
Will update this section soonish. 

## Bugs / Warnings
- A list of current bugs / warnings with hosting a dedicated server can be found [here](https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/hosting-a-dedicated-server-back-end-problems.454786).

## Server Configurations
- A guide on the structure of game hosting configuration can be found [here.](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Community/bannerlord_documentation/blob/main/server_config.md)

### Maps

The maps used for server hosting are not the same as their in-game
names, a dictionary of the maps named in the backend of the files with their in-game names and also a screenshot of how they look is provided [here.](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Community/bannerlord_documentation/blob/main/map_dictionary.md)

## Debugging 
Try seeing if there is a community solution listed [here](https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/hosting-a-dedicated-server-back-end-problems.454786/). Otherwise, I'd strongly recommend asking in the bl-mp-servers channel on the M&B Modding [Discord](https://discord.gg/92uJp7YD2u).
